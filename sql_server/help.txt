Some secrets don't last long... but theyâ€™re set in memory often.
When they expire, "something" in the system appears to brings them back.

I heard a Martin the monkey said secret_key one time. Not sure what that meant. 

He also really liked using a "5w0rd". No idea where that means.

But he only liked "1" sword.
