think some cows from the web_user team got in to the and coded up a little program
not sure what they tried to do though cause it doesn't do anything apart from moo
weird... anyway time for a song break from /usr/local/bin radio

I'm gonna teach you, teach you, teach you
all about love girl, all about love
sit yourself down, take a seat
all you gotta do is repeat after me
